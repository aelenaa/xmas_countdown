# Christmas Advent Countdown!!
This webpage combines a countdown to Xmas with the tradition German advent candles, which light up in the weeks leading up to Christmas. There is also a little surprise video/gif/meme for every day of Advent. Like a chocolate calendar, but funny content instead.

## Motivation
This is the first webpage I made using html, css and js. It was a fun project and a great way to learn a lot of skills.

## Getting Started
setup.cmd installs cherrypy, which is the only installment needed.

RUN.cmd runs xmas.py

Easy Peasy.

## Links
Links.csv contains all the 'surprise' content. This can easily be added to and dates don't have to be added in chronological order. 

**Note** 
Dates must be written as (day, month) with a space after the comma.
As an example, the first day of the year is (1, 1) and NOT (01, 01) or (1, 01) or (01, 1) or (1,1)

## Acknowledgements
The wreath and candles on this page are largely inspired by examples on codepen.io
